# Forza-Motorsport-Helper
I'm releasing it because I found it useful. Maybe it can help you too. Planning on updating it with other features...

For now it has 4 options:

- 1 Start a anti afk, so you can go to sleep while racing without getting that 'are you still plaing message' every 15 min. It will ask you for how much minutes do you want to run it.
  the key pressed is random, betwenn a,w,s,d

- 2 Find the exact moment when the race will end, so you can put it into the anti afk and don't have to worry about the anti afk pressing keys in the menu. Planning on adding a feature to automaically close the game. P.S. before enabling the afk, wait to the ai to finish 1 lap, so you can put the lap time here and get the exact time for the ending of the race.

- 3 Setup the variables for the anti afk. The input delay is the time between each key press.

- 4 Visit my Github :)

If you found some bugs, please report them to my github page.

#Use the 3rd option first!!
